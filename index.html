  <h1>Aslı's Stellar Arts</h1>
  <p> Hi, Everyone. Welcome to my webpage.My name is Aslı. As someone who has placed learning at the center of her life, I define myself as a "forever student". Digital art and software are the two main areas where I express myself.</p>
  <p> Aslı's Stellar Arts,reflects my name Aslı and also carries the meaningful meaning of “stellar”, which is “belonging to stars, bright and inspiring”. "ASA" is the abbereviation of Aslı's Stellar Arts, and it is my digital name.</p>
  <p> The name “ASA” is both the warm beginnings of my name Aslı and the symbol of that endless universe full of stars and inspires. In every project,I carry to inspiration I get from the stars and take care to make them shine like sparkles.</p>
